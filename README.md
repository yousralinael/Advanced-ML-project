# Advanced-ML-project

After reading and understanding "Implicit Regularization in Matrix Factorization" (2017) by Gunasekar et al., we tried to implement some theoritical results.
We work on the MovieLens dataset "https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/", and we implement a descent gradient on the factorization of the matrix then solve the minimization problem of the nuclear norm in order to compare them. All our code and comments can be found in 'Matrix_recovery.ipynb'. The dataset we used is 'ratings.csv'.
